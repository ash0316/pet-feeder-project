Problem Statement
Design the logical behaviour for a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder for an animal shelter that:
•	Dispenses measured amounts of dry food for cats and dogs at scheduled times.
•	Monitors whether food was actually dispensed and whether it was eaten (or how much was eaten).
•	Alerts shelter staff if an issue occurs (e.g., no food dispensed, food not eaten after a reasonable time, jam, or low food supply).
The deliverable is a logical/system design and simulation-ready specification (not hardware build). The final system should be implementable using low-cost components (servo/stepper motor, load cell or IR sensor, simple microcontroller).
Required features 
1.	Feeding schedule management
o	Multiple daily feeding times (e.g., 08:00, 13:00, 18:00).
o	Configurable portion size per feeding (grams).
2.	Dispense control
o	Command to dispense exactly one scheduled portion on time.
o	Manual dispense override (staff can trigger immediate dispense).
3.	Dispense verification
o	Confirm that a dispense event actually released food.
4.	Consumption monitoring
o	Detect whether food was eaten within a timeout window (e.g., 30 minutes).
o	Measure amount consumed if possible.
5.	Alerts & logging
o	Alert staff on failures (no dispense, jam, food uneaten, low food level).
o	Maintain log of dispense events, sensor readings and alerts for troubleshooting.
6.	Basic UI / staff interface
o	Simple display or mobile/web API to configure schedule, view logs and receive alerts.
7.	Fail-safe behavior
o	Retries and safe error-handling (e.g., if first dispense fails, attempt once more).
o	Safe default on power outage or sensor failure (log error, alert staff).

Inputs (data / sensors / user inputs)
User inputs
•	Feeding schedule (list of timestamps).
•	Portion size (grams per feeding).
•	Manual dispense command.
•	Thresholds (e.g., low food level threshold, uneaten-time threshold).
Sensor inputs
•	Dispense sensor: confirms movement of dispenser (e.g., rotary encoder, switch on dispenser, or current sensor on motor) → boolean/encoder counts.
•	Food presence / quantity sensor:
o	Option A: Load cell under food bowl → continuous weight reading (grams).
o	Option B: IR/ultrasonic sensor to detect presence/level → distance or boolean.
o	Option C: simple beam-break (binary) to detect if food present at bowl.
•	Food hopper level sensor: low-level switch or distance sensor → boolean.
•	Optional: Camera + simple image processing (higher cost) → detect consumption visually.
Time & system inputs
•	Real-time clock (RTC) or system clock for scheduling → timestamp.
Outputs (actuators / alerts / logs)
Actuators / Outputs
•	Motor/servo control signal to operate dispenser (command: rotate steps or open gate).
•	Visual/audible indicators (LED, buzzer) for local alerts.
•	UI/API responses for remote monitoring.
Alerts & Notifications
•	Notifications to staff via UI, SMS/email (if connected), or local buzzer/LED:
o	No-food-dispensed
o	Food-not-eaten (after timeout)
o	Low-food-level
o	Repeated jam/failure
Logs / Data
•	Time-stamped records: scheduled time, dispense attempt(s), dispense confirmation status, bowl weight before/after, alerts triggered.
Assumptions
1.	Feeder dispenses dry kibble only (uniform particle size and flow).
2.	One feeder per bowl (not multi-bowl per device). System can be extended to multiple feeders later.
3.	Shelter provides mains power or battery with RTC; network connectivity is optional.
4.	Portion sizes are within motor/dispenser mechanical capability (e.g., 5–200 g).
5.	Simple sensors (load cell, IR, limit switch) are used — no advanced ML for the basic solution.
6.	Staff can access local UI or an admin web page to see alerts and change schedule.

Limitations
1.	System may be less accurate for wet or irregular food shapes.
2.	Camera-based detection and advanced analytics are outside minimum viable scope (optional enhancement).
3.	Memory/storage for logs assumed modest (e.g., microcontroller flash or small SD card).
