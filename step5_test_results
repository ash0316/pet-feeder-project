Scenario	Inputs	Expected Output	Actual Logic Output	Improvement Suggestions
Pet eats as expected	Feeding time 08:00, hopper level OK, bowl empty	Dispense food, detect consumption, log success	Works as intended	None needed
Pet does not eat	Feeding time 18:00, hopper OK, bowl weight unchanged after 30 min	Send “Food not eaten” alert, log event	Works as intended	Consider sending reminder after 1 hour
Food bin empty	Feeding time, hopper level low	Send “Low hopper” alert, skip feeding	Works as intended	Add automatic log to refill list
Motor jammed	Feeding time, hopper OK, bowl weight unchanged immediately after motor run	Send “No food dispensed” alert	Works as intended	Add automatic retry before sending alert

Refinements:
1.	Add redundancy – Retry dispensing once before alerting staff to avoid false positives.
2.	Variable feeding sizes – Adjust amount of food depending on pet size or health needs.
3.	Energy saving mode – Put sensors and motor in low-power state when idle.
4.	Wi-Fi or SMS alerts – For remote notification of staff.
