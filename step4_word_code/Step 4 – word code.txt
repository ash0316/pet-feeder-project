Key Variable Names & Roles:
•	feedingTimes → List of times to dispense food.
•	hopperLevelSensor → Measures food storage.
•	bowlWeightSensor → Measures amount of food in bowl.
•	motor → Controls dispensing of food.
•	alertSystem → Sends messages to staff.
•	DISPENSE_DURATION → How long motor runs to dispense one meal.
•	MIN_HOPPER_LEVEL → Minimum food level before refill is required.
•	MIN_BOWL_WEIGHT → Minimum expected weight after dispensing.
•	CONSUMPTION_CHECK_DELAY → Time allowed before checking if food is eaten.
